      in 1989, Talin created the award-winning Music-X MIDI sequencer for the 
      Amiga. Music X eventually became one of the most well-known and popular 
      Amiga programs. Later, Talin started work on MeV, an entirely new music 
      sequencer designed for BeOS. </font> 
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">Talin summed it 
        up this way: &quot;The goal was to provide a user experience that was 
        even more dynamic and powerful than that provided by Music-X, and to do 
        so on a fast, modern and multimedia-enabled hardware/software platform.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">Due to time conflicts 
        (holding down a professional programming career while creating a major 
        music product in your spare time isn't easy), Talin discontinued the development 
        of MeV as a commercial application. He then offered to release the source 
        code to the BeOS user community as open source software. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">Early in 2000, the 
        first members of the MeV team volunteered to take on the project. After 
        demonstrating the knowledge and skill needed to create an application 
        meeting a high standard of quality, Talin officially turned ownership 
        of the code over to the newly-formed MeV team.</font> </p>
