		This is a preview release of MeV, an open-source MIDI sequencer for
		BeOS. Originally developed as a commercial application by Talin,
		development is now being continued by a team of developers and the
		code is under the Mozilla Public License 1.1. 
	</p><p>
		The primary intention for this release is to get valuable early
		feedback on the overall design and architecture of the application. 
	</p><p>
		It is possible to use MeV now in a limited fashion. You can create
		music by drawing and editing MIDI notes and performance parameters.
		We will soon be adding necessary features such as the ability to
		record MIDI data and load standard MIDI files. 
	</p><p>
		We wanted to get the program into your hands for feedback even
		before some of these important features were implemented. We also
		feel it's important to show some progress with a major BeOS open
		source project. Even in its current preliminary state, MeV is
		already a remarkable program.
	</p><p>
		We offer a friendly challenge to the teams working on other similar
		projects to bring out timely releases so everyone can offer input
		and share the excitement of forward momentum. 
	</p><p>
		We are pleased to see the growing list of MIDI, audio and video
		software for BeOS. BeOS provides a place where multiple applications
		can work well together and we are encouraged to see other developers
		creating great tools for media production. 
	</p><p>
