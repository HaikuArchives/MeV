		Currently MeV is a MIDI sequencer.  However it is our goal create a
		media-independent sequencer. One of our central ideas for the future
		direction of MeV is total modularity when it comes to different
		types of media. Support for MIDI, audio and video as well as for
		more "esoteric" things like generative music, will each be
		encapsulated into plugins.
	</p><p>
		The advantage for the user is that any type of time-based content
		can be integrated into a single environment without losing any of
		the user-friendliness of dedicated tools. Obviously this is a lot of
		work, and will take significant time to accomplish.
	</p><p>
		Many other things will have to be done first. For example, the
		recording system has not yet been implemented, nor has
		synchronization to MTC or SMPTE. But the focus on media
		independence is valuable now as we design not only a great MIDI
		sequencer but an encompassing production environment. Keep this goal
		in mind as you test this preliminary version and offer suggestions. 
	</p><p>
		Your suggestions are important to help us build excellent production
		tools. Please check out <a href='contact.html'>this</a> page to find out
		how you can get involved with the project.
