      MeV is a MIDI sequencer. However it is our goal create a media-independent 
      sequencer. One of our central ideas for the future direction of MeV is total 
      modularity when it comes to different types of media. Support for MIDI, 
      audio and video as well as for more &quot;esoteric&quot; things like generative 
      music, will each be encapsulated into plugins. </font> 
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">The advantage for 
        the user is that any type of time-based content can be integrated into 
        a single environment without losing any of the user-friendliness of dedicated 
        tools. Obviously this is a lot of work, and will take significant time 
        to accomplish. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">Many other things 
        will have to be done first. For example, the recording system has not 
        yet been implemented, nor has synchronization to MTC or SMPTE. But the 
        focus on media independence is valuable now as we design not only a great 
        MIDI sequencer but an encompassing production environment. Keep this goal 
        in mind as you test this preliminary version and offer suggestions. </font></p>

        are important to help us build excellent production tools. Please check
