		To get MeV output sound asap, follow these steps:
		<ol>
			<li>In the <font color="#00638a"><b>Inspector</b></font> window, select
				<b>'New...'</b> from the Destination menu field.
			<li>A new destination window will be displayed, where you can give the
				destination a name, port, channel and color. Choose
				<b>'Internal Synth'</b> as port, and <b>'1'</b> as channel.
			<li>In the Parts window, right click on "Untitled Part 1" and select 
				<b>'Rename'</b> from the context menu. Call it "Piano" and hit return.
			<li>Drag & drop the part into the <font color="#00638a"><b>Assembly</b>
				</font> window, where a blue-box style representation of the part will
				show up.
			<li>Back in the Parts window, double click on the "Piano" part and a
				window for editing that part will come up.
			<li>Use the pencil tool to draw a few notes in the piano roll strip. You
				should hear the notes being played back when creating or modifying them.
			<li>Press the play button in the <font color="#00638a"><b>Transport</b>
				</font> window. You should now be hearing the notes you entered before.
			<li>You can adjust the velocity of the notes (which is often directly mapped
				to their loudness) by clicking in the 'Velocity' strip and dragging the
				mouse cursor over the velocity curves you want to change. If you use
				the left mouse-button, attack velocity will be affected, while the right 
				mouse button changes release velocity.
			<li>To change the sound of the notes, you have to insert MIDI program changes.
				Select the 'Program Change' item from the pencil tool drop-down list
				and click into the 'Sequence' strip. A new event with a horn icon and
				text will appear, resembling the program change event. The left offset
				of this event determines when it will take effect. In the
				<font color="#00638a"><b>Inspector</b></font> window you can change the 
				program by dragging the corresponding slider.
			<li>If you'd like to speed up or slow down the song, you have to adjust the
				tempo control in the <font color="#00638a"><b>Transport</b></font> window.
				Do this by either dragging the digits vertically, or by right-clicking the
				control and manually enter the speed (which is measured in <b>bpm</b>,
				beats-per-minute).
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Some other random notes:
		<ul>
			<li>Cut, Copy & Paste is not fully implemented. Within windows/strips you can
				copy events by dragging them while holding down they control key, which 
				will effectively clone the selection.
			<li>You can use the fancy 'lasso-select' mode to select multiple events that
				otherwise couldn't be selected just using rectangle mode. Start
				lasso selection by right clicking in the strip and dragging the mouse
				around the events you want to be included in the selection.
			<li>Make use of the 'Repeat' event to loop sections of the song.
			<li>When you load a song that uses the BeOS Internal Synth, MeV might need
				some time to start up the synth, and this currently looks a bit as if the
				program had crashed for a split second. Better indication of what's going
				on will be added some time in the future.
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, be sure to check out the included example songs. They're as cheap and
		cheesy as you'd expect from demo songs... well, I guess they're even cheesier. But
		they might help you understand the concepts and interface of MeV.
