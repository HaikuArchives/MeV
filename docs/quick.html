	<hr>
	<p>
		When you launch MeV for the first time, you should see the
		<font color="#00638a"><b>Assembly</b></font> window, which is
		the main interface for song arrangement.
	</p><p>		
		The Assembly window is a special variant of the generalized window framework 
		used in MeV to display different types of events in musical time, allowing
		multiple components, dubbed <font color="#00638a"><b>Strips</font></b>,
		to be inserted into the editor window. A similar kind of window is used for
		editing individual parts.
		<ul>
			<font color='#777777'><i>In most MIDI sequencers, you have a variety of
			ways you can view a track or sequence of notes - 'piano roll' editor,
			drum editor, event list, etc. MeV integrates these diverse ideas into a
			unified approach that utilizes "nested" editing contexts, wherein a
			high-level editor window can have several smaller tools or components
			nested inside of it.</font></i>
		</ul>
		Each strip is an object that can represent a different aspect of the
		musical performance, such as note pitch, note velocity, aftertouch,
		repeat bars, and any other aspect of the musical performance. Each
		strip can be vertically scrolled and zoomed independently of all the
		other strips, but in horizontal scrolling the strips always move in
		sync. By adding and deleting strips, the user can customize the editing
		display to see desired parameters and hide unwanted information.
	</p>

	</p><p>
		You'll also see several palettes:
	</p><p>
		<font color="#00638a"><b>Transport</b></font><br>
		The Transport window contains the transport buttons (like
		playback/stop/pause), using the familiar "tape deck" metaphor you
		know from many other applications. There is a slider for settings
		the initial tempo of the song.
	</p><p>
		<font color="#00638a"><b>Inspector</b></font><br>
		The Inspector currently has three purposes: 
		<ul>
			<li>It lets you modify the current selection using the sliders on the left side.<br><br>
				Depending on the type of event that is currently selected in the
				active window these sliders will have different functions, indicated
				by their label. Some events may only have one adjustable parameter,
				others two or three. The adjustments you make here will also be used
				as defaults for newly-added event
			<br><br>
			<li>It is used to manage the list of destinations.
				To create a destination:
				<ol>
					<li>Select "New..." from the destination drop-down list.
					<li>Select the ports & channels you want to use.
					<li>Give it a nice name and color if you wish.
				</ol>
		</ul>
	</p><p>
		<font color="#00638a"><b>Parts</b></font><br>
		The Parts window shows a list of all parts in the active document.
		You can create a part by pressing Alt+N or selecting "New"->"Metered
		Part" from the menu. 
		To edit the part in a new window, double-click it or select "Edit"
		from its context menu. MeV will open the Linear Editor (**is this
		the final name?) where you can edit the part.
	</p><p>
		<font color="#00638a"><b>Grid</b></font><br>
		The original Music-X was inspired by the "grid snap" feature found
		in CAD systems, and in particular used the idea that "grid offset
		errors" should be preserved while dragging. This approach is
		standard today, but MeV takes a step further by allowing you to
		define the grid in a very flexible way. Each measure is conceived
		as a "structure" or "scaffolding" upon which musical events are hung,
		and you control the geometry of that scaffolding. 
	</p><p>
		<ul>
			<font color='#777777'><i>The snap size can also be any arbitrary
			interval - it doesn't have to be an even number of grid units per
			measure, although the start of a measure is always a snap point
			(the grid "resets" at each measure).</i></font>
		</ul>
