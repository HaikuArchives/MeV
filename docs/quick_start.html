    <td colspan="5" height="21" valign="top"><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">To 
      get MeV output sound asap, follow these steps: </font> 
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">In the Inspector 
        window, select 'New...' from the Destination menu field. <br>
        A new destination window will be displayed, where you can give the destination 
        a name, port, channel and color. Choose 'Internal Synth' as port, and 
        '1' as channel. <br>
        In the Parts window, right click on &quot;Untitled Part 1&quot; and select 
        'Rename' from the context menu. Call it &quot;Piano&quot; and hit return. 
        <br>
        Drag &amp; drop the part into the Assembly window, where a blue-box style 
        representation of the part will show up. <br>
        Back in the Parts window, double click on the &quot;Piano&quot; part and 
        a window for editing that part will come up. <br>
        Use the pencil tool to draw a few notes in the piano roll strip. You should 
        hear the notes being played back when creating or modifying them. <br>
        Press the play button in the Transport window. You should now be hearing 
        the notes you entered before. <br>
        You can adjust the velocity of the notes (which is often directly mapped 
        to their loudness) by clicking in the 'Velocity' strip and dragging the 
        mouse cursor over the velocity curves you want to change. If you use the 
        left mouse-button, attack velocity will be affected, while the right mouse 
        button changes release velocity. <br>
        To change the sound of the notes, you have to insert MIDI program changes. 
        Select the 'Program Change' item from the pencil tool drop-down list and 
        click into the 'Sequence' strip. A new event with a horn icon and text 
        will appear, resembling the program change event. The left offset of this 
        event determines when it will take effect. In the Inspector window you 
        can change the program by dragging the corresponding slider. <br>
        If you'd like to speed up or slow down the song, you have to adjust the 
        tempo control in the Transport window. Do this by either dragging the 
        digits vertically, or by right-clicking the control and manually enter 
        the speed (which is measured in bpm, beats-per-minute). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">Some other random 
        notes: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">Cut, Copy &amp; 
        Paste is not fully implemented. Within windows/strips you can copy events 
        by dragging them while holding down they control key, which will effectively 
        clone the selection. <br>
        You can use the fancy 'lasso-select' mode to select multiple events that 
        otherwise couldn't be selected just using rectangle mode. Start lasso 
        selection by right clicking in the strip and dragging the mouse around 
        the events you want to be included in the selection. <br>
        Make use of the 'Repeat' event to loop sections of the song. <br>
        When you load a song that uses the BeOS Internal Synth, MeV might need 
        some time to start up the synth, and this currently looks a bit as if 
        the program had crashed for a split second. Better indication of what's 
        going on will be added some time in the future. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">In addition, be 
        sure to check out the included example songs. They're as cheap and cheesy 
        as you'd expect from demo songs... well, I guess they're even cheesier. 
        But they might help you understand the concepts and interface of MeV.
