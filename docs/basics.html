      A big difference between MeV and traditional sequencers is that MeV lacks 
      the concept of tracks. In MeV, you have Parts and Destinations.</font> 
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">Destinations represent 
        certain endpoints in your system that live outside of MeV, like the virtual 
        MIDI port of a software synthesizer or a physical MIDI output. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">Parts can contain 
        many different events (like notes, pitch bend, controller data, etc), 
        each potentially going to a different destination. This is an uncommon 
        convenience. Most MIDI sequencers require you to organize your events 
        by the port and channel that they will be transmitted on. MeV breaks down 
        this barrier and allows you to organize your events in a way that fits 
        the structure of your music. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">When you launch 
        MeV for the first time, you should see the Assembly window, which is the 
        main interface for song arrangement.
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">The Assembly window 
        is a special variant of the generalized window framework used in MeV to 
        display different types of events in musical time, allowing multiple components, 
        dubbed Strips, to be inserted into the editor window. A similar kind of 
        window is used for editing individual parts. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Swis721 BT, Verdana, Helvetica" size="1">In most MIDI sequencers, 
        you have a variety of ways you can view a track or sequence of notes - 
        'piano roll' editor, drum editor, event list, etc. MeV integrates these 
        diverse ideas into a unified approach that utilizes &quot;nested&quot; 
        editing contexts, wherein a high-level editor window can have several 
        smaller tools or components nested inside of it. <br>
        Each strip is an object that can represent a different aspect of the musical 
        performance, such as note pitch, note velocity, aftertouch, repeat bars, 
        and any other aspect of the musical performance. Each strip can be vertically 
        scrolled and zoomed independently of all the other strips, but in horizontal 
        scrolling the strips always move in sync. By adding and deleting strips, 
        the user can customize the editing display to see desired parameters and 
        hide unwanted information. </font></p>
