	<hr>
	<p>
		Back in 1989, Talin created the award-winning Music-X MIDI sequencer
		for the Amiga. Music X eventually became one of the most well-known
		and popular Amiga programs. Later, Talin started work on MeV, an
		entirely new music sequencer designed for BeOS.
	</p><p>
		Talin summed it up this way: "The goal was to provide a user
		experience that was even more dynamic and powerful than that
		provided by Music-X, and to do so on a fast, modern and
		multimedia-enabled hardware/software platform." 
	</p><p>
		Due to time conflicts (holding down a professional programming
		career while creating a major music product in your spare time isn't
		easy), Talin discontinued the development of MeV as a commercial
		application. He then offered to release the source code to the BeOS
		user community as open source software. 
	</p><p>
		Early in 2000, the first members of the MeV team volunteered to take
		on the project. After demonstrating the knowledge and skill needed
		to create an application meeting a high standard of quality, Talin
		officially turned ownership of the code over to the newly-formed MeV
		team.
